Taking on additional work
Overview

A Skilled Worker visa allows you to come to or stay in the UK to do an eligible job with an approved employer.

This visa has replaced the Tier 2 (General) work visa.

It also allows you to work in UK waters.

Eligibility
Your job

To qualify for a Skilled Worker visa, you must:

work for a UK employer that’s been approved by the Home Office
have a ‘certificate of sponsorship’ (CoS) from your employer with information about the role you’ve been offered in the UK
do a job that’s on the list of eligible occupations
be paid a minimum salary - how much depends on the type of work you do and the date you got your CoS

The specific eligibility depends on your job.

You must have a confirmed job offer before you apply for your visa.

Knowledge of English

You must be able to speak, read, write and understand English. You’ll usually need to prove your knowledge of English when you apply.

If you’re not eligible for a Skilled Worker visa

You may be eligible for another type of visa to work in the UK.

How long you can stay

Your visa can last for up to 5 years before you need to extend it. You’ll need to apply to extend or update your visa when it expires or if you change jobs or employer.

If you want to stay longer in the UK

You can apply to extend your visa as many times as you like as long as you still meet the eligibility requirements.

After 5 years, you may be able to apply to settle permanently in the UK (also known as ‘indefinite leave to remain’). This gives you the right to live, work and study here for as long as you like, and apply for benefits if you’re eligible.

How to apply

You must apply online.

How you apply depends on whether you’re:

outside the UK and are coming to the UK
inside the UK and extending your current visa
inside the UK and switching from a different visa

If you want to change your job or employer, you must apply to update your visa.

Your partner and children may be able to apply to join you or stay in the UK as your ‘dependants’.

How long it takes

You can apply for a visa up to 3 months before the day you are due to start work in the UK. This date is listed on your certificate of sponsorship.

As part of your application, you’ll need to prove your identity and provide your documents.

You may need to allow extra time if you need an appointment to do this. You’ll find out if you need one when you start your application.

Getting a decision

Once you’ve applied online, proved your identity and provided your documents, you’ll usually get a decision on your visa within:

3 weeks, if you’re outside the UK
8 weeks, if you’re inside the UK

You may be able to pay to get a faster decision - you’ll be told if you can when you apply.

If your application is successful, your decision email will tell you what you’ll get to prove your immigration status and what you need to do next.

How much it costs

You, your partner or children will each need to:

pay the application fee
pay the healthcare surcharge for each year of your stay
prove you have enough personal savings

Check how much money you’ll need.

If you work in public sector healthcare

If you’re a doctor or nurse, or you work in health or adult social care, check if you’re eligible to apply for the Health and Care Worker visa instead. It’s cheaper to apply for and you do not need to pay the annual immigration health surcharge.

What you can and cannot do

With a Skilled Worker visa you can:

work in an eligible job
study
bring your partner and children with you as your ‘dependants’, if you meet the eligibility requirements
take on additional work in certain circumstances
travel abroad and return to the UK
apply to settle permanently in the UK (also known as ‘indefinite leave to remain’) if you’ve lived in the UK for 5 years and meet the other eligibility requirements
do voluntary work

Any voluntary work you do must be unpaid and for one of the following:

a registered charity
a voluntary organisation 
an associated fundraising body (an organisation that raises money for a charity or voluntary organisation)
a statutory body (a government-appointed body, for example Historic England)

You cannot:

apply for most benefits (public funds), or the State Pension
change jobs or employer unless you apply to update your visa

If your application is successful, you’ll get a full list of what you can and cannot do with a Skilled Worker visa.

Overview

A Graduate visa gives you permission to stay in the UK for at least 18 months after successfully completing an eligible course in the UK.

You must be in the UK when you apply.

Eligibility

You can apply for a Graduate visa if all of the following are true:

you’re in the UK
your current visa is a Student visa or Tier 4 (General) student visa
you studied a UK bachelor’s degree, postgraduate degree or other eligible course for a minimum period of time with your Student visa or Tier 4 (General) student visa
your education provider (such as your university or college) has told the Home Office you’ve successfully completed your course

You can ask your education provider if you’re not sure whether they’ve told the Home Office you’ve successfully completed your course.

Check if your course is eligible and how long you need to have studied in the UK.

If you’re not eligible for a Graduate visa, you may be eligible for another type of visa to stay in the UK.

How long you can stay

A Graduate visa lasts for:

2 years if you apply on or before 31 December 2026
18 months if you apply on or after 1 January 2027

If you have a PhD or other doctoral qualification, it will last for 3 years.

Your visa will start from the day your application is approved.

If you want to stay longer in the UK

You cannot extend your Graduate visa. However, you may be able to switch to a different visa, for example a Skilled Worker visa.

Check you can apply for another type of visa to stay in the UK.

How to apply

You must apply online for a Graduate visa.

Your partner and children can also apply to stay in the UK if they are eligible.

When to apply

You must apply before your Student visa or Tier 4 (General) student visa expires.

You can apply after your education provider (such as your university or college) has told the Home Office that you’ve successfully completed the course you took with your Student or Tier 4 (General) student visa. You do not have to wait until you’ve graduated or have been given a certificate.

As part of your application, you’ll need to prove your identity and provide your documents.

Your application may take longer if you need an appointment to do this. You’ll find out if you need one when you start your application.

Getting a decision

You can stay in the UK while you wait for a decision.

How much it costs

When you apply for a Graduate visa, you’ll need to:

pay the £880 application fee
pay the healthcare surcharge - this is usually £1,035 for each year you’ll be in the UK

Check how much it will cost.

If you work in public sector healthcare

If you’re a doctor or nurse, or you work in health or adult social care, check if you’re eligible to apply for the Health and Care Worker visa instead. It’s cheaper to apply for and you do not need to pay the annual immigration health surcharge.

If you get a job in public sector healthcare after you have paid the healthcare surcharge, you may be able to get a refund.
